More than two months have passed since I wrote my last post. In those two months, a lot of stuff happend:

I’ve decided to leave my old employer [medienreaktor][1] in favour of going a completely different way than the one someone in my age would normally go. My initial idea was to start freelancing, and that’s also what I’m currently doing. However, I’m not really sure if it will stay that way. So instead of just doing my work, I’ve also decided to pull some additional levers. And in the next few months, one of those might turn out to be better for me than just playing the lone wolf and doing everything alone.

While I’m very proud to finally be able to pay for my own life by myself, I also miss how much fun it is to work together with a team. Nevertheless, I wanted to grow into a different, extended direction. So it’s still the best decision I could make. I finally have more time to focus on the new stuff that’s currently happening on the web. I’ve learned a lot about JavaScript’s latest standard (ES2015), web tooling, how to create such tools and also finally strengthened my design skills. All in all, I feel like I have more time to enjoy what really matters to be: Bulding great software.

However, I definitely need to find a way to combine this new way of being with a better social environment than the one I currently have. It does make an awful lot of fun to write and design such things, but it makes even more fun to do so with a awesome team.

But as I said: The next few months will decide how I proceed with this.

Another big thing that happend to my life is [Muffin][2]. It took me nearly half a year to convert my thoughts and ideas into a working product. At first, it was really tough. And when I say “really”, I mean “really”. I’ve created a lot of things on the web, but this one is without doubt the biggest one of all.

More than four complete iterations of the design, multiple rewrites of the whole codebase and countless cups of tea went into it. But all in all, it was definitely worth it.

If you want to learn more about what Muffin actually does and why it’s awesome, take a read at [this][2]. If you’re more into the design part, rather than into how it works, check out the [Dribbble project][3].

Thanks to my new schedule, I was also able to finally start journaling again. For the past months, it was something I simply didn’t have enough time for. Text seems simple, if you can just read it. But if you’re writing, it consumes a lot of effort and time.

Nevertheless, it’s awesome to be able to look back on what you’ve done in your life. And that outweighs all of the trouble. As the author Anaïs Nin once said: It allows you to...

> ...taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.

So if you haven’t tried it already, you definitely need to. Just grab the latest version of the beautiful app [Day One][4] and start right over today!

Oh. And stay tuned, of course. I’ll keep you updated on how my plans for my future are coming along.
