More than 5 years have passed since WhatsApp saw the light of day for the first time. Now it was even acquired by the biggest social network out there: Facebook. But in my opinion, the acquisition wasn't really useful. Facebook did little or nothing to make progress and make the app better than it was.

Okay, they changed the interface a bit and added some tiny new features. But the some real big things like a API for developers or even just a nother instance for OS X or Windows never entered the conversation. To me, it feels like Facebook just doesn't give a shit about the app, maybe they just bought it because they wanted its users data...

This has the consequence that WhatsApp now isn't able to compete with all the other IM-Messengers out there, there are many services that have well-documented APIs (like [Telegram][1]) and much better interfaces, as well as native applications for desktop and also web instances (WhatsApp lately also got a shiny web-version, but It's not even working for all platforms).

That means to me: In the next days I'll stop using this stupid app and I'll also recommend my friends to use a different kind of messenger. 

Sorry, Facebook!
