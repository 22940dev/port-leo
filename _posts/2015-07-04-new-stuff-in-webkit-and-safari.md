title: What's new in Safari 9.0
---

Over the last few years, Apple didn't really contribute much to the whole topic of web development. With Safari, we as developers were facing a browser which wasn't really able to keep up with all the cool things other ones like Chrome or Firefox had already introduced in the glimpse of an eye. Part of the reason for this is probably the slow release-cycle which still hasn't changed.

If you open up the App Store on your OS X- or iOS-device, you'll quickly notice that the only times Safari got an upgrade, was when the OS itself was updated. In this case, other browsers which aren't installed by default benefit from a independent release-cycle which helps developers to push things forward without needing to wait for an OS update.

But this time, I won't make more words about this topic. While I hope Apple will change this in the future and set up an independent update-channel, I want to present you the great stuff they and the other contributers to the WebKit project will introduce with the next update of OS X - [take a look][1].
