    <P>
      Since the first release of Electron{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v0.1.0">
        in 2013
      </Link>{' '}
      we{`'`}ve come a very long way: With the high goal of conquering native,
      the web{`'`}s ambassadors (you and me) developed various useful projects
      for all kinds of use cases.
    </P>

    <P>
      Nowadays, many of the daily tasks previously handled by native apps are
      now done by software that runs on top of Electron: Editing code (<Link href="https://atom.io">Atom</Link>),
      sending and receiving messages (<Link href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">
        WhatsApp
      </Link>, <Link href="https://slack.com/downloads">Slack</Link>) or emails
      (<Link href="https://www.nylas.com/nylas-mail/">Nylas Mail</Link>) and
      even complex things like running commands (<Link href="https://hyper.is">Hyper</Link>):
    </P>

    <Tweet id="812011746638569472" className="tweet" />

    <P>
      To sum this up, I don{`'`}t think I have to tell you anymore how important
      it is and how big its impact on our industry is today. And yet, it{`'`}s{' '}
      <Link href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=electron">
        still growing
      </Link>!
    </P>

    <P>
      Of course, these achievements weren{`'`}t completely free of charge:
    </P>

    <P>
      We{`'`}ve spent hours convincing our fellow coworkers that a rewrite was
      worth it. We held conferences and spread the word across the whole globe,
      so that all of us may have the ability to make convert their app ideas
      intro reality.
    </P>

    <P>
      In addition,{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/electron/electron/graphs/contributors">
        some of us
      </Link>{' '}
      even contributed their own spare time and spent it reporting issues,
      fixing bugs and making Electron better!
    </P>

    <P>Sure, all of this has been very difficult and time consuming.</P>

    <P>
      But{' '}
      <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRojY4uZNI8&t=15s">
        let{`'`}s not rest
      </Link>{' '}
      now!
    </P>

    <P>
      There{`'`}s still a long way ahead of us: More operating systems and
      devices are waiting for us! We{`'`}re barely halfway there. So much more
      to discover!
    </P>

    <H2>The Dream</H2>

    <P>
      But enough of the üëè cheering üëè now. With the above in mind, I{`'`}d like
      to introduce you to a new concept of building Electron apps:
    </P>

    <P>
      So far, we{`'`}ve either been using vanilla JavaScript or some sort of
      custom Webpack/Babel/Gulp setup to handle building the{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/3decb5eb28ffacc587c5b8fe201483a8b65b4138/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md#renderer-process">
        renderer process
      </Link>.
    </P>

    <P>
      At <Link href="https://zeit.co">ZEIT</Link>, we{`'`}ve gathered a lot of
      experience with this topic in the past and discovered a much more
      efficient and more straightforward way to handle this:{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js">Next.js</Link>!
    </P>

    <P>
      Yes, I{`'`}m serious. It{`'`}s not just very good for sites and web apps,
      but it also makes creating Electron apps as easy as you{`'`}ve never seen
      it before. That{`'`}s because it allows us - as app developers - to
      abstract most of the complex development environment away into a tiny
      toolbet.
    </P>

    <P>
      Once implemented,{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js">Next.js</Link> will take care
      of:

        <Link href="https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx">styled-jsx</Link>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      In order for Next.js bundles to fit perfectly into how we{`'`}re building
      Electron apps (and to make deploying easier), we also released{' '}
      <Link href="https://zeit.co/blog/next3-preview">a feature</Link> that lets
      you export static files for the use in the production version of your app.
    </P>

    <P>
      And that{`'`}s <Link href="https://zeit.co/blog/next">
        not even all
      </Link>{' '}
      yet!
    </P>

    <P>
      So why can{`'`}t we have these wonderful features inside an Electron app
      without a complicated configuration setup? Well... Starting today, it{`'`}s
      actually possible! üéâ
    </P>

    <H2>Making the Dream Come True</H2>

    <P>
      As the first step into the light, we{`'`}ll spin up a fresh Electron
      boilerplate. This will make you understand how to create the perfect
      renderer process using Next.js, but also how to implement it into your
      existing application.
    </P>

    <P>
      Thankfully, they already provide a suitable{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start">
        skeleton app
      </Link>{' '}
      which can easily clone to our device using this command (<Link href="https://git-scm.com">Git</Link>{' '}
      and <Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</Link> need to be
      installed):
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>
      git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
    </Code>

    <P>
      Once it has finished setting up a clone that you can interact with on your
      local machine, move into the directory of the repository:
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>{`cd electron-quick-start`}</Code>

    <H3>Installing the Dependencies</H3>

    <P>
      Now that we got the boilerplate, let{`'`}s make sure that the pre-defined
      dependencies are installed. To do so, you only need to run the following
      command:
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>{`npm install`}</Code>

    <P>
      Next, install the remaining dependencies that we{`'`}ll need to the
      renderer. First, we{`'`}ll start with the{' '}
      <InlineCode>devDependencies</InlineCode>: The core package of{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js">Next.js</Link> (used in
      development), <Link href="https://github.com/facebook/react">
        react
      </Link>{' '}
      and{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom">
        react-dom
      </Link>{' '}
      (bundled with the production version of your app):
    </P>

    <Code
      language="bash"
      syntax={bash}
    >{`npm install next react react-dom --save-dev`}</Code>

    <P>
      As the last installation step, we need to define{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/leo/electron-next">electron-next</Link>,
      which ensures that Electron can handle Next.js{`'`} output in the
      renderer:
    </P>

    <Tweet id="881783902691577856" className="tweet" />

    <P>
      It will be used both in production and development, so it needs to be
      installed as a normal dependency:
    </P>

    <Code
      language="bash"
      syntax={bash}
    >{`npm install electron-next --save`}</Code>

    <H3>Testing the Boilerplate</H3>

    <P>
      Before we go on, I suggest ensuring that you{`'`}ve followed the
      instructions carefully. To do so, you can start the boilerplate
      application:
    </P>

    <Code language="bash" syntax={bash}>{`npm start`}</Code>

    <P>
      If you{`'`}ve done everything right, a window like this one should open:

      width="512"

      sentence. If not, please repeat the steps from{' '}
