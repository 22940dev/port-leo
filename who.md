#### What?

**First off:** No, this is not my new homepage. It's only a basic set-up which I wanted to finally put out there so I can write more posts while finishing the design. :smile:

On this domain, you'll soon see my next real personal website (finally, since a few years). Well, I discarded many layouts and blogging platforms, but I think I finally found the right one: A static site, powered by [Jekyll][1] and hosted on [GitHub][2].

As soon as the new layout is online, I'll use this site to publish many of my ideas and other kinds of articles. I will also present a few my work and complain about things that bug me.

#### Who?

I'm a 17-year-old student (just a few months left) who has been building awesome stuff since he first got in contact with the art of creating websites in 2010.

Right now, I'm working incidentally at a local agency called [medienreaktor][3] where I'm responsible for developing websites (and soon also apps).

In the past months I was really focused on finding the right direction which I wanted to go and I think I really got a pretty strong idea of what I want now.
