# leo.im [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/leo/leo.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leo/leo.github.io)

This is where you'll find all the links to the places where my work lives. You can find my old post (those that haven't made it to Medium) in the `_posts` directory.

## Caught a bug?

Clone it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io.git
```

Install Jekyll and a special gem from GitHub

```sh
gem install jekyll github-pages
```

Run Jekyll within the repo! :dizzy:

```sh
cd leo.github.io
jekyll serve --watch
```
