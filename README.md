This is where you'll find all the links to the places where my work lives. If you want to see the old version of the site (including all of the old posts), you can find it [here](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io/tree/407778d22e4611f873daf2fb2431cf08ef9dffef).

## Caught a bug?

Clone it

```

Run Jekyll within the repo! :dizzy:

cd leo.github.io
jekyll serve --watch
```
